## Problem to solve
Write a Python function that takes a list of elements and returns the count of unique elements in the list. Your function should iterate through the list and use a set to keep track of unique elements.

``` python
def count_unique_elements(input_list):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Example Usage
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 1]
result = count_unique_elements(numbers)
print(result)
# Expected Output: 8 (unique elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
